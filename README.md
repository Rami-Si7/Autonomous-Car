# Autonomous Car Project
In this project, we developed a simulation for autonomous driving using the Godot game engine. The system integrates state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques, including the Nvidia Dave-2 model for steering prediction  and YOLO(You Only Look Once) for object detection. The simulation consists of seven tracks designed to test various autonomous driving capabilities, such as lane merging, speed sign detection, obstacle avoidance, lane change and autonomous parking. The results of our test tracks showed great performance although the server side ran on CPU, with hardware which has a GPU compatible with Cuda, the performance will be better.
